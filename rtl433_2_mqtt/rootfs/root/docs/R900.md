Intermittent leaks are described by Neptune in other public docs as: "Intermittent leak indicates that water has been used for at least 50 of the 96 15-minute intervals during a 24-hour period". A continuous leak indicates use in every 15-minute period over the past 24 hours.


NoUse and Leak are numbers between 0 and 6 that represent the number of days within the last 35 days the condition has occured:

Value	Days
