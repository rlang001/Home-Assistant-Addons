# Home Assistant Add-on: WeeWX-HA

_WeeWX addon to read weather sensors._

## About
You can use this add-on to install WeeWX, an open-source a free, open source, software program, written in Python, which interacts with your weather station to produce graphs, reports, and HTML pages. It can optionally publish to weather sites or web servers. It uses modern software concepts, making it simple, robust, and easy to extend. For more information, please see [weewx].

I wanted to leverage my current Home Assistant instance to run WeeWX.  Currently I use the RTL-SDR library to read data directly from my weather sensor as the HA hardware resides in an incovenient location to connect to the console via USB.  As a bonus, if you don't have a sensor, grab the data from your neighbor's :).
